### Hi there 👋, I am M Abdullah Asift!!

Over the past two years, I have worked in Laravel, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap technologies. I am a motivated and hardworking young web developer. I have developed a solid foundation in web development throughout my career and have delivered projects successfully using these technologies. I put a lot of work into developing online applications that are aesthetically pleasing, beneficial, and user-friendly. I have a strong desire to keep up with industry trends and to constantly broaden my knowledge and skill set. I am eager to contribute to team projects and deepen my knowledge of web development.
