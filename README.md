### Hi there 👋, I am M Abdullah Asif!!

I am M Abdullah Asif, a software engineer and web developer with strong experience in Laravel, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I build scalable web applications with a focus on responsive design, clean interfaces, and strong user experience. Over the years, I have delivered front-end and back-end solutions that balance visual appeal with solid engineering.

My work extends to CRM automation and data-driven systems. I design and implement automated workflows that help businesses streamline operations and improve efficiency. I have also built REI-focused platforms and integrated systems for teams that rely on fast, accurate information flow.

As the founder of StackRoot Solutions, I lead projects from initial concept through deployment. I focus on creating reliable digital systems that support growth and deliver measurable results.
